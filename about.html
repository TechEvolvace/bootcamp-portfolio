            <h2>Hi, I'm Phuc Dinh!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate student studying for a B.S. Biology 
                with a certificate in Programming and Computation at the University of Texas at Austin.
                I'm also enrolled in MIT's Full-Stack Development Bootcamp program! In my free time, 
                I also help develop and design a new website for a student organization in my university, 
                Longhorn Neurotech, as one of their UI/UX Interface Developer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to branch out to topics that fascinates with me, and I develop 
                websites to test out interesting and essential features of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python,
                and other programming concepts and tools I learn on the way. After testing those features, 
                I record my observations as comments in the code files for the websites or in Markdown files 
                for each individual experiment website I make! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The times I encounter bugs are usually frustrating, but those times are what excites me! 
                Tweaking which component in the codebase to see what outcomes happens and then mapping out 
                how each component in each file for a project into flowcharts on Canva documents, whether for 
                independently exploring new concepts, helping out for a project with a student organization, 
                or for an assignment, really helps makes the debugging process easier for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These are what makes me who I am, as an eager software developer ready to learn and get hands-on 
                with new stuff! Refining my skills is part of the package that comes along with going on that journey to me!
